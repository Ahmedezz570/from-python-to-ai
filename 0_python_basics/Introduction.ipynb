    "## 1) Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "## 2) Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "## 3) Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "## 4) Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "## 5) Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way."
